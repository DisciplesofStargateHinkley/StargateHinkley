<p><h1>Learn the TRUTH behind STARGATE HINKLEY and it's REAL purpose.</h1></p>
<br>
<p><b><font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000, 0 0 5px yellow">The "Official" Narrative:</font></b> <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font>, most commonly know as the "Desert Lighthouse", is located deep within the Mojave Desert near the desert town of Hinkley, CA - not far from Edwards Air Force Base. This lonely part of the Mojave Desert is heavily militarized and is considered a strategic corridor during the coming apocalyptic nuclear fallout, but more importantly it is adjacent to a known primary access point to space for governmental and commercial entities. In 2017, the Desert Lighthouse appeared suddenly and without explanation. Within six months, news reports began surfacing about its arrival - attributing Daniel Hawkins <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">(The KEEPER)</font> as creator of the mysterious structure. <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font> has claimed to have no affiliation with the US Government or any private space companies - instead he explains his journey to be of "existential importance". A number of news outlets quoted <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font> saying, <I>"It came to me in a vision as I traveled through the desert at night ... now I am amidst an existential quest to maintain a beacon of light so that we can all find ourselves in the great void."</I> <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font>'s claims continued: <I>"I have been tasked with bringing light to the Mojave and to create a point of connection so the human experience no longer remains untethered in our cosmic darkness."</I></p>
<br><br>
<h3>THE VISION: What We Know</h3> 
<p>If one is to truly <I>receive</I> <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPERS</font>'s claim of establishing connection in the "cosmic darkness", we can <I>absorb</I> the true purpose of the "Desert Lighthouse". <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font>'s intervention in Mojave's desolate expanse clearly intends to remedy Earth's isolation in the universe by connecting it to the stars - through what we feel is more aptly titled, <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font>. What is <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font>? It is the cosmic gateway that will bring an age of intergalactic travel. True believers who join <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px pink">The DISCIPLES OF STARGATE HINKLEY</font> will gain access to an unbounded existence in the universe's unlimited expanse. Why do we call it <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font>, and not the "Desert Lighthouse"? The <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px pink">D.o.S.H.</font> believe <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font> refers to <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> as the "Desert Lighthouse" in order to mask the true purpose of the structure temporarily in order to keep it safe from unfriendly entities until it is able to fulfill its true purpose. Who is behind <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font>? Our research suggests <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font> is an individual operating under the alias Daniel Hawkins. We believe <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font> is connected to impossible advancements in space travel technology we have seen since the first appearance of <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> in 2017. <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font> maintains multiple identities to protect the urgent realization of <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> and the arrival of the <I>Cosmic Ascension</I>. Deep research show <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font> has secretive ties to Silicon Valley - a possible source of his technology. There is more to learn about <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font>'s life but we know he has been contacted by entities unknown to facilitate the inventible - the moment when a cosmic door is opened between Earth and the galactic skies.

<h3>STARGATE HINKLEY: The Preto-type That Worked?!</h3>
<p><font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000, 0 0 5px yellow"><b>"It arrived in a vision, bringing light to the cosmic darkness. But was destiny an accident?"</b></font>
<br><br>
<font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> miraculously arrived in 2017 bringing light to our darkness. Little is known about <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font>'s "Development Stage" other than what <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font> has revealed -  <I>"...it took 10 years to manifest the Desert Lighthouse [<font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font>], and it was a perilous journey with great risk to myself and many others."</I> <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font>'s is clearly referencing Earth as the "many others". The "risk" is if <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> fails, the <I>Cosmic Ascension</I> fails, and EARTH is lost.
<br><br>
Fortunately, <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font> succeeded! And that unendurable negative version of the future did not occur. But was <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> always destined to succeed? Where ELON MUSK, JEFF BEZOS, and ALL governmental space agencies have failed, <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> has prevailed! But WHY? <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> is leveraging technologies that MUSK and his contemporaries alike are desperately trying understand. Parallels between <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> and others' failed attempts are visible. Methodologies are recognizable. Designs reminiscent. They ALL appear to be trying to reverse engineer <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> technology. However, their quests and guiding principles to commercialize this cosmic technology have misguided their efforts and resulted in the improbable to become reality. 
<br><br>
<font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000, 0 0 5px yellow"><b>"Was STARGATE HINKLEY expected to be an operational gateway? Or was it a pathfinder that exceeded all expectations set for it?"</font></b>
<br><br>
A sympathetic insider at SpaceX told us that they have been tirelessly trying to understand <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font>. The company, is said to be relying on Neuralink recipients as a method to "farm" human consciousness in order to predict the path into galactic space. These Neuralink Cogs have repeatedly concluded that the innovations delivered to <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font> in his <I>original vision</I>, delivered from unknown entities, were only supposed to introduce a Preto-type technology into our consciousness to start the next wave of space advancements, not for <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> to <I>become</I> the advancement itself. However, due to <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px white">The KEEPER</font>'s pure and unconstrained <I>vision</I>, the realization of <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> transcended the Preto-type phase and has reached operational status. Although we have not experienced the <I>Cosmic Ascension</I> yet, we expect to in the immediate future. The desperation and fear driving "the competitors" leads us to believe the full prophecy of <font style="text-shadow: 0 0 3px yellow">STARGATE HINKLEY</font> and its access to the cosmic sky is imminent.

<h3>At The Cosmic Crossroads: What's Next?</h3>
